# Unreal Engine 4.2x C++ Boilerplate
 One of the most frustrating things about Unreal Engine is starting up an 
 empty project where you need to st up and connect all the scafolding. Especially 
 if you are trying to work it out in C++. There are web sites out there that 
 help to quickly set up, but I created this repo so that i can keep it 
 handy each time 
 
 All of the bolerplate code is Blueprint free. It is done entirely in 
 C++.
 
 This repo is a boilerplate of essential components already conencted with 
 samples of how to do some pretty commonly asked stuff on the net.
 
 If it helped you, thumbs up! I am happy it did.
